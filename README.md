# Credit Card Fraud Detection Project Documentation

## Overview

### Dataset

The dataset comprises credit card transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. The dataset covers two days and contains 284,807 transactions, with 492 identified as fraudulent. The imbalance in class distribution necessitates the use of specialized metrics, with frauds representing only 0.172% of all transactions.

### Data Features

The dataset consists of numerical features resulting from a PCA transformation. However, due to confidentiality constraints, the original features and background information are withheld. Key features include V1 to V28 (principal components), 'Time' (seconds elapsed between transactions), 'Amount' (transaction amount), and 'Class' (response variable, 1 for fraud, 0 otherwise).

### Class Imbalance

Given the significant class imbalance, traditional accuracy metrics are unsuitable. Evaluation will primarily focus on the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) to provide a meaningful assessment of model performance.

## Neural Network Prediction

In addition to conventional methods, neural networks will be employed for credit card fraud detection. The application of neural networks allows for the identification of complex patterns within the data, enhancing the model's ability to discern fraudulent transactions.

## Data Download

The dataset is available for download from Kaggle: [Credit Card Fraud Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/downloads/creditcardfraud.zip/3)

## Data Preprocessing

Prior to model training, the dataset will undergo essential preprocessing steps. This includes handling missing values, scaling features, and addressing class imbalance. These steps are critical for ensuring the model's efficacy in distinguishing between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

## Model Evaluation

The primary metric for assessing model performance is the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC). The evaluation will encompass precision, recall, and other relevant metrics, providing a comprehensive analysis of the model's capabilities.

## Conclusion

This documentation aims to deliver a detailed overview of the credit card fraud detection project. Covering dataset specifics, preprocessing steps, model evaluation metrics, and the incorporation of neural networks, the goal is to establish a robust and accurate fraud detection system tailored to the challenges posed by highly imbalanced transaction data.
